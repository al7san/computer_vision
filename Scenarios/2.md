# Integrated Scenario (Computer Vision Systems II)

## Scenario

You are working on a **video-based intelligent security system** deployed in a large
public facility (e.g., airport or university campus).

The system analyzes:
- **RGB images** captured by fixed cameras
- **Video sequences** with multiple people moving simultaneously

The objectives of the system are to:
- Classify objects and scenes
- Track people across frames
- Recognize abnormal activities
- Maintain good generalization and training stability
- Provide interpretable and reliable predictions

The system integrates concepts from:
**CNN architectures, Optimization & Loss Functions, LSTMs, GANs,
Feature Extraction, and Model Interpretability**.

Answer the following questions.

---

## Question 1 – Image Representation

The system stores color images as tensors with shape `(H, W, 3)`.

**Question:**  
What does each dimension represent, and why is this representation important
for CNN-based models?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

H and W represent the image height and width, and 3 represents the RGB color channels.
This structured representation allows CNNs to exploit spatial and channel-wise
correlations during convolution.
</details>

## Question 2 – CNN Architecture Choice

A shallow CNN performs poorly on complex scenes with many objects.

**Question:**  
Why do deeper CNN architectures generally perform better for complex image understanding?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

Deeper CNNs learn hierarchical features, progressing from edges and textures
to object parts and semantic representations, which improves performance on
complex scenes.
</details>

## Question 3 – Overfitting Prevention

During training, the model achieves very high training accuracy but low validation accuracy.

**Question:**  
Identify the issue and list two methods to reduce it.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

The issue is overfitting. Techniques such as Data Augmentation, Dropout,
L2 Regularization, or Early Stopping can reduce it.
</details>

---

## Question 4 – Data Augmentation vs Synthetic Data

The dataset is limited and unbalanced.

**Question:**  
Explain how **Data Augmentation** helps, and how it differs from **Synthetic Data** generation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

Data augmentation modifies existing samples using transformations to increase diversity,
while synthetic data creates entirely new samples, often using generative models.
</details>

---

## Question 5 – Optimization Strategy

Training with **Batch Gradient Descent** is stable but very slow.

**Question:**  
Which alternative optimization strategies can speed up training, and why?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Mini-batch Gradient Descent update weights more
frequently, leading to faster convergence and better scalability.
</details>

---

## Question 6 – Video Analysis Pipeline

The system performs **multi-object tracking** across video frames.

**Question:**  
Why must object detection be combined with tracking methods such as Kalman Filter
or DeepSORT?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

Detection identifies objects in individual frames, while tracking maintains object
identity across frames, enabling continuous trajectory analysis.
</details>

---

## Question 7 – Temporal Modeling

For abnormal behavior detection, frame-level CNN predictions are inconsistent.

**Question:**  
Why is an **LSTM** added after the CNN, and what problem does it solve?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

LSTMs model temporal dependencies across frames, smoothing predictions and enabling
recognition of time-dependent activities.
</details>

---

## Question 8 – GAN-based Data Enhancement

To improve robustness, **GAN-generated images** are added to the training set.

**Question:**  
What is the benefit of using GANs for this purpose, and what risk must be considered?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

GANs increase data diversity and reduce overfitting. However, poorly trained GANs
may introduce unrealistic or biased samples.
</details>

---

## Question 9 – Feature Visualization

During debugging, feature maps from early and deep CNN layers are visualized.

**Question:**  
What differences would you expect to see between early-layer and deep-layer visualizations?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

Early layers capture edges and simple textures, while deeper layers encode
high-level semantic features such as object parts and categories.
</details>

---

## Question 10 – System Reliability

Small, imperceptible noise added to images causes incorrect predictions.

**Question:**  
What phenomenon does this illustrate, and what does it reveal about deep models?

<details>
<summary><strong>Hidden Answer</strong></summary>

This illustrates adversarial examples, revealing that deep models can be sensitive
to small perturbations and may rely on non-robust features.
